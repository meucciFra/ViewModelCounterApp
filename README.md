# ViewModelCounterApp
viewmodelcounter is a sample to experiments and get familiar (because I'm not at all) with Android App Architecture suggested by Google but this is fully written in Java.
It has the purpose to learn Andorid and the App Architecture without any particular focus on UI or meaningfullness of the app itself.

I know Java but Java and Java API are so vaste that I always feel I got 5% of the whole picture. 
So, that's why I ignored the Google suggestion to start developing new apps with Kotlin (one more think to leanr) in 2021 to avoid adding complexity over complex topic
